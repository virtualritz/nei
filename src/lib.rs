//! # Nodal Scene Interface -- ɴsɪ
//! A flexible, modern API for offline 3D renderers
//!
//! [Nsɪ](https://nsi.readthedocs.io/) is built around the concept of
//! nodes. Each node has a *unique handle* to identify it. It also has
//! a [type](nsi_core::node) which describes its intended function in
//! the scene.
//!
//! Nodes are abstract containers for data. The interpretation depends
//! on the node type. Nodes can also be [connected to each
//! other](https://nsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guidelines.html#basic-scene-anatomy)
//! to express relationships.
//!
//! Data is stored on nodes as attributes. Each attribute has a name
//! which is unique on the node and a type which describes the kind of
//! data it holds (strings, integer numbers, floating point numbers,
//! etc).
//!
//! Relationships and data flow between nodes are represented as
//! connections. Connections have a source and a destination. Both can
//! be either a node or a specific attribute of a node. There are no
//! type restrictions for connections in the interface itself. It is
//! acceptable to connect attributes of different types or even
//! attributes to nodes. The validity of such connections depends on
//! the types of the nodes involved.
//!
//! What we refer to as the ɴsɪ has two major components:
//!
//! 1. Methods to create nodes, attributes and their connections. These are
//!    attached to a rendering [`Context`].
//!
//! 2. [Nodes](nsi_core::node) understood by the renderer.
//!
//! Much of the complexity and expressiveness of the interface comes
//! from
//! [the supported nodes](https://nsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nodes.html).
//!
//! The first part was kept deliberately simple to make it easy to
//! support multiple ways of creating nodes.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```
//! // Create a context to send the scene to.
//! let ctx = nsi::Context::new(None).expect("Could not create NSI context.");
//!
//! // Create a dodecahedron.
//!
//! // 12 regular pentagon faces.
//! let face_index: [i32; 60] = [
//!     0, 16, 2, 10, 8, 0, 8, 4, 14, 12, 16, 17, 1, 12, 0, 1, 9, 11, 3, 17, 1,
//!     12, 14, 5, 9, 2, 13, 15, 6, 10, 13, 3, 17, 16, 2, 3, 11, 7, 15, 13, 4,
//!     8, 10, 6, 18, 14, 5, 19, 18, 4, 5, 19, 7, 11, 9, 15, 7, 19, 18, 6,
//! ];
//!
//! // Golden ratio.
//! let phi: f32 = 0.5 * (1.0 + 5_f32.sqrt());
//!
//! // Golden ratio conjugate.
//! let phi_c: f32 = phi - 1.0;
//!
//! // 20 points @ 3 vertices.
//! let positions: [f32; 60] = [
//!     1., 1., 1., 1., 1., -1., 1., -1., 1., 1., -1., -1., -1., 1., 1., -1.,
//!     1., -1., -1., -1., 1., -1., -1., -1., 0., phi_c, phi, 0., phi_c, -phi,
//!     0., -phi_c, phi, 0., -phi_c, -phi, phi_c, phi, 0., phi_c, -phi, 0.,
//!     -phi_c, phi, 0., -phi_c, -phi, 0., phi, 0., phi_c, phi, 0., -phi_c,
//!     -phi, 0., phi_c, -phi, 0., -phi_c,
//! ];
//!
//! // Create a new mesh node and call it 'dodecahedron'.
//! ctx.create("dodecahedron", nsi::MESH, None);
//!
//! // Connect the 'dodecahedron' node to the scene's root.
//! ctx.connect("dodecahedron", None, nsi::ROOT, "objects", None);
//!
//! // Define the geometry of the 'dodecahedron' node.
//! ctx.set_attribute(
//!     "dodecahedron",
//!     &[
//!         nsi::points!("P", &positions),
//!         nsi::integers!("P.indices", &face_index),
//!         // 5 vertices per each face.
//!         nsi::integers!("nvertices", &[5; 12]),
//!         // Render this as a subdivison surface.
//!         nsi::string!("subdivision.scheme", "catmull-clark"),
//!         // Crease each of our 30 edges a bit.
//!         nsi::integers!("subdivision.creasevertices", &face_index),
//!         nsi::floats!("subdivision.creasesharpness", &[10.; 30]),
//!     ],
//! );
//! ```
//! ## More Examples
//!
//! All the examples in this crate require a (free) [3Delight](https://www.3delight.com/)
//! installation to run.
//!
//! ### Interactive
//!
//! Demonstrates using the [`FnStatus`] callback closure during rendering.
//!
//! ### Jupyter
//!
//! Render directly into a Jupyter notebook.
//!
//! Follow
//! [these instructions](https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md) to
//! get a Rust Jupyter kernel up and running first.
//!
//! ### Output
//!
//! This is a full [`output`] example showing color conversion and writing data
//! out to 8bit/channel PNG and 32bit/channel (float) OpenEXR formats.
//!
//! ### Volume
//!
//! Demonstrates rendering an [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/) asset. Mostly
//! through the [`toolbelt`] helpers.
//!
//! ## Getting Pixels
//!
//! The crate has support for streaming pixels from the renderer, via callbacks
//! (i.e. closures) during and/or after rendering via the [`output`] module.
//! This module is enabled through the feature of the same name (see below).
//!
//! ## Cargo Features
//!
//! * [`output`] -- Add support for streaming pixels from the renderer to the
//!   calling context via closures.
//!
//! * [`jupyter`] -- Add support for rendering to Jupyter notebooks (when using
//!   a [Rust Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/google/evcxr)).
//!
//! * [`toolbelt`] -- Add convenience methods that work with a [`Context`].
//!
//! * [`delight`] -- Add some nodes & shaders specifi to 3Delight.
//!
//! * `nightly` -- Enable some unstable features (suggested if you build with a
//!   `nightly` toolchain)
//!
//! * `ustr_handles` -- use [`ustr`](https://crates.io/crates/ustr) for node
//!   handles. This will give a you a speed boost if your node names aren't
//!   changing while an app using ɴsɪ is running but is not advised otherwise
//!   (`ustr` are never freed).
//!
//! ## Linking Style
//!
//! The 3Delight dynamic library (`lib3delight`) can either be linked to during
//! build or loaded at runtime.
//!
//! By default the lib is loaded at runtime.
//!
//! * Load `lib3deligh` at runtime (default). This has several advantages:
//!
//!   1. If you ship your application or library you can ship it without the
//!      library. It can still run and will print an informative error if the
//!      library cannot be loaded.
//!
//!   2. A user can install an updated version of the renderer and stuff will
//!      ‘just work’.
//!
//! * Dynamically link against `lib3delight`.
//!
//!   * `lib3delight` becomes a dependency. If it cannot be found your lib/app
//!     will not load/start.
//!
//!   * The feature is called `link_lib3delight`.
//!
//!   * You should disable default features (they are not needed/used) in this
//!     case:
//!
//!     ```toml
//!     [dependencies]
//!     nsi = { version = "0.7", default-features = false, features = ["link_lib3delight"] }
//!     ```
//!
//! * Download `lib3delight` during build.
//!
//!   * `lib3delight` is downloaded during build. Note that this may be an
//!     outdated version. This feature mainly exists for CI purposes.
//!
//!   * The feature is called `download_lib3delight`.
